Automatically convert a (javascript) react codebase to use the format.js api using [auto-i18n-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/auto-i18n-react).

## Installation

    npm install -g auto-i18n-react

## Usage

Convert all javascript files in a given directory:

    auto-i18n-react --target path/to/target/directory


# Notes

This will only convert all translatable text within the app to be compatible with the API (in any files postfixed with .jsx).  You will still need to add the top level wrapper component (IntlProvider) as well as any necessary changes to your build tooling.

The algorithm is a bit aggressive so it's possible that there were some false positives but those are pretty easy to find once you have the translation file (generated by `formatjs extract`).  It will not handle more complicated things like pluralization or rich text formatting.  Those are edge cases that will need to be handled manually.  

It is safe to run this multiple times on the same codebase (in case more translatable strings are added later).
